# Configs
These are my configuration files for my Linux setup.
### NOTE
* All configurations are customized for me and my use cases, so it can be useful for someone who needs a minimal setup based on [Suckless](https://suckless.org/). 
* The installation script and inherent scripts are designed to be applied to my system file structure and what I need from this software to do, so it is sometimes not set well for your machine, it works fine all the time for me (you can configure it manually without scripts)
* This setup is mainly for [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/), but you can change the package manager in scripts and it works 90% for all Unix systems.
## Installation
* Before starting you should install dependencies with or after arch installation .
```console

$ sudo pacman -S base-devel git stow

```
* After running install.sh the scripts start to install all needed software or system software from [Pacman](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Pacman) or [AUR](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Arch_User_Repository) 
```console

$ chmod +x install.sh
$ ./install.sh

```
* The configuration files are managed by [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) which is a symlink manager that manages all files from the repo and it sets all true locations for them it works from the script, but if you need to make it manually here is it.
```console

$ stow --target=$HOME/.config $(ls <package name>)

```
